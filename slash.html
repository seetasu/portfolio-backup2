                        Douchi is fermented soybeans. A strong-flavoured ingredient but it seasons the dishes amazingly. <br>
                        <b>Instructions:</b> <br>
                        When the pan is hot with oil, put douchi, slices of ginger, dried chilli in the pan till you get the fragrance out. Add beef first, when the color of the beef changed, add potato slices. When you think the potato is about ready, add in the green pepper, cook for another 30s to 1 min and then you can enjoy it with steamed rice. <br>
                        <b>Tips</b><br>
                        Keep stiring the ingredients in the process, add some water when the ingredients are fried out, water helps to cook the potato faster, and to blend the smell evenly.

                        The <a href="http://sulezhi.com/el.html" target="_blank">Final Master Project -- El</a> is a project with intensive desk research and hands-on prototyping. I was impressed at the beginning of FMP, and also in my previous objects about TUI, when I saw the fantastic projects and research done by wonderful people. But one thing seldom come to my mind is what is the necessity of researching certain topic. Especially MIT media lab. As an outstanding organization, they studied on all kinds of media that can be used to express information and serve as engaging interfaces. When I was reading the papers time and time again, actually making ferrofluid display, I came to know the reasons. Information carrier is a crucial element in designing for Tangible User Interface (TUI). TUI must be expressive constantly, so the meaning it communicates will be changing. Especially when it is used in a growing system (like smart home system). LEDs are widely used for TUI in commercial field. Since they are cheap and can be programmed easily. So to find out matter that can be programmed individually as pixels do on the screens is a tough yet significant direction. As I experienced it, I think ferrofluid as a media for TUI is greatly promising. By coding the behaviour of ferrofluid, playing with the shape of magnets, distances between magnets and ferrofluid, it has a great richness. <br> <br>
                        What Tangible User Interface addresses is to employ user’s cognitive skills, emotion skills and perceptual-motor skills in a comprehensive way. Among them, cognitive skills can be used very often and sometime too much. To teach users how to use something by setting users a list of “rules” (various LED flashing patterns matching with various messages). This happens quite often in designs with LEDs and shape-changing interfaces. And I think they are sometimes a solution because of designer’s being “lazy”. LEDS, voice control, shape-changing interfaces are three leading interactions existing respectively in current market, future market and academic field. I, as both a designer and a user, could not depict a world with only anyone of them. Therefore, what I could do in my design, is try my best to avoid heavy cognition burden, making use of diverse interactions and skills, in order to provide a better user experience. <br> <br>
                        In the FMP, in order to get  the power consumption data, I used smart plugs from a Dutch brand: <a href="https://www.plugwise.nl/" target="_blank">Plugwise</a>. But it took me a lot of time and efforts to abstract the data. I read about the HTTP protocols of Plugwise, tried to understand Node.js, just to bring the data to the front-end and fed it to El. And the barriers on the road, the complexity is owned to the enclosed system of the smart plugs. Smart plugs are the most efficient and basic means to intelligentialize your home, since it gives normal appliances a schedule and a remote switch. If these plugs can be made with more openess, with more APIs, plus a flexible bridge like <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank">IFTTT</a>, it will be easier for the users, to customize their life at a lower cost. All these great opportunities are there, and made me even more interested in smart home industry. I feel very challenging yet I’m expecting to continuously learning about it in the future.  <br><br>
